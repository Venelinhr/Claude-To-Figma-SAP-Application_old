# documented, not enforced. This hook makes it mechanical. The plugin runtime
# plugin/figma-builder/code.js is ~45k tokens and is NEVER needed for a
# use_figma build — every key/token it holds is in SAP_BUILD_MANIFEST.md.
#
# Tool input arrives as JSON on stdin (.tool_input.file_path) — NOT via env var.
# Exit 2 blocks the Read; stderr becomes the agent's feedback (redirect to manifest).
