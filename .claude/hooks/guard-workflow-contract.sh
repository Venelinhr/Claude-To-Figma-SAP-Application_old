# guard-workflow-contract.sh — PreToolUse hook on mcp__figma__use_figma. BLOCKING (advisory-once).
#
# Ensures the WORKFLOW-CONTRACT is acknowledged before ANY use_figma call — build, edit,
# improvement, or variant. This closes the drift gap where follow-up "improve this screen"
# edits skipped the rules (raw 72 fonts, native dividers, placeholder tabs, native components).
#
# Enforcement is "once per session": the FIRST use_figma call of a session is blocked unless the
# .workflow-loaded marker exists. The marker is written ONLY by load-workflow-contract.sh at
# SessionStart (proving the contract directive was injected into context) or by capture-approvals.sh
# from the user's own acknowledgment. The AGENT CANNOT write it — the marker-write PreToolUse guard
# blocks any attempt, so this gate cannot be self-satisfied. If the marker is missing, the session
# did not bootstrap the contract → block and tell the agent to self-load it (read the file), since
# it cannot forge the marker.
#
# Registered under mcp__figma__use_figma AFTER guard-agent-turn1 and BEFORE guard-wireframe-gate.
# Exit 2 blocks; stderr is the agent's feedback. Exit 0 passes.
