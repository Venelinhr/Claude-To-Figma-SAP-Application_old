# F-2 (2026-07-22, Performance Recovery): approvals are now BUILD-scoped, not TURN-scoped.
# Previously this wiped .wireframe-approved / .architect-approved / .scratch-approved on EVERY
# Stop, so a multi-turn build on the SAME screen had to re-present the wireframe + re-earn
# approval every turn (the re-approval treadmill, RC-3 — the exact cause of the wizard-fix stall).
# Now: on Stop we clear only the per-build PLAN artifacts (.reuse-declared, .delta-spec.json);
# the user's wireframe/architect/scratch APPROVAL survives across turns of the same build and is
# cleared only at SessionStart, or when hand-off completes (a *-verify.json was produced → the
# build is done, the next screen must be re-approved). This preserves the anti-self-echo property
# (only capture-approvals.sh, fired by a real user prompt, ever WRITES an approval) while removing
# the redundant re-approval work.
