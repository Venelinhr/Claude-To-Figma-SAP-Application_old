<workflow-contract-directive>
⛔ BEFORE ANY Figma SAP task — new screen, improvement suggestion, next step, edit, or
variant — you MUST read and OBEY WORKFLOW-CONTRACT.md (project root). It is the single
mandatory source of truth: 31 rules + 10-step flow + hard rules + skills + lessons.

On EVERY such request: (1) load the contract, (2) analyze the source screen's SAP
tokens/instances/states first, (3) follow the 10-step flow + 31 rules, (4) use only real
SAP components/tokens/text-styles (never native look-alikes, raw hex, or raw 72 font),
(5) preserve menu/component states, (6) hand off with a validated node URL + Bind reminder.

This applies to follow-up edits and "improve this screen" requests too. To repair an
existing non-compliant screen, run /sap-fix <nodeId>.
