# mark-build.sh — PostToolUse(use_figma) hook. Stamps .claude/.last-build-node when a BUILD ran.
#
# WHY (drift-audit 2026-07-22, GAP #2/#5 — the fail-OPEN hole): the whole "100% SAP screen"
# guarantee rests on verify-invariants.js (Gate 6/7) running post-build. But lint-on-stop.sh
# (Gate 9) only BLOCKS hand-off when it sees a build happened without a verify.json — and it
# detects "a build happened" via .last-build-node, which NOTHING wrote. So an agent that simply
# never ran the verifier handed off clean (fail-open). This hook writes that marker automatically
# whenever use_figma mutates the canvas, making lint-on-stop's "build but no verify → BLOCK"
# branch reachable. The verifier is no longer optional.
#
# This is a SYSTEM-written marker (PostToolUse, not agent Bash), so it is NOT the agent
# self-forging an approval — it attests "a build tool ran", which is objectively true.
