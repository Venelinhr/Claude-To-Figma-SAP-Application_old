# guard-architect-gate.sh — PreToolUse hook · Gate 0.5 (Architect-First Reasoning). BLOCKING.
#
# WHY: the pipeline was implementation-first — a plain TEXT business request could jump
# straight to component selection with no business→IA→floorplan reasoning. RULE 20's
# "Reasoning Brain" existed but was GUIDANCE with no gate reading its artifacts (same dead-
# enforcement class the drift audit found). This makes architect-first reasoning a HARD gate
# for from-scratch text builds.
#
# Fires before a use_figma BUILD. BLOCKS (exit 2) unless .architect-approved exists —
# UNLESS the build is exempt (see SKIP below). The marker is written ONLY by
# capture-approvals.sh from the user's own architect-approval words; Claude cannot self-echo it.
#
# ORDER: this runs BEFORE guard-wireframe-gate.sh. Flow for a new text screen:
#   business statement → information architecture → floorplan+rationale → (architect approved)
#   → ASCII wireframe → (wireframe approved) → build.
#
# SKIP (exempt from architect reasoning — these are NOT new-from-text builds):
#   • a canonical CLONE is declared (.reuse-declared level 1–4) — architecture is inherited
#   • a from-scratch build was explicitly consented (.scratch-approved) AND wireframe approved
#   • the wireframe was already approved via an IMAGE flow (reference image drives architecture)
#   • repairs / small edits: the code clones/setProperties an existing node without creating a new screen root
