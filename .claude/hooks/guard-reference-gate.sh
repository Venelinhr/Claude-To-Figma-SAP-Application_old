# guard-reference-gate.sh — PreToolUse(use_figma) hook · GATE 0 (Canonical Reference Selection). BLOCKING.
#
# The single highest-leverage decision in the workflow is WHICH canonical reference to clone. Picking
# wrong cascades into manual patching, silent failures, screenshot loops, and 30k+ wasted tokens (the
# wizard disaster, 2026-07-22). This gate makes that decision mandatory and explicit BEFORE any build:
# a use_figma BUILD is blocked (exit 2) unless a scored reference decision has been recorded via
# build/record-reference.js (writes .claude/.reference-selected).
#
# Fires BEFORE guard-wireframe-gate.sh so the reference is locked before the wireframe reflects it.
#
# Pass conditions:
#   • .reference-selected exists AND its score >= 60                          → PASS (a real match chosen)
#   • .reference-selected exists AND score < 60 AND .scratch-approved exists   → PASS (user OK'd scratch)
#   • otherwise                                                                → BLOCK (exit 2)
#
# The marker is written ONLY by record-reference.js (agent runs score-canonical.js, then records the
# chosen node). Raw-Bash writes of the marker are blocked by the marker-write guard (settings.json),
# so this cannot be self-forged.
