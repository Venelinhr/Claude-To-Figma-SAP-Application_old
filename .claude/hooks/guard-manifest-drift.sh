#
# SAP_BUILD_MANIFEST.md §3 is the component-key source the build agent reads. If it has drifted
# from the registry (a stale/wrong figmaComponentId), a build's importComponentSetByKeyAsync will
# 404 at runtime — the exact fail-closed case that must NOT be reached silently. This gate runs the
# drift checker BEFORE a key-dependent use_figma build and blocks (exit 2) if the manifest is stale.
#
# Complements manifest-sync-check.sh (PostToolUse notice on manifest edit). This one is the hard
# pre-build gate. Read-only use_figma calls pass silently.
